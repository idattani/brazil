in question about "public2 type build
single page app



The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

  "homepage" : "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

had to install npm install nodemailer --save in the functions directory
Somehow gave project alias dev
sudo firebase deploy --project dev   sudo firebase deploy --project default

sudo firebase use to see the aliases

I had a similar problem and it turned out that I was deploying to a different alias of the same project. You can have many aliases within a project (i.e. versions of the same project) , but only one alias will be visible to people visiting your site.

Entering firebase use <alias_or_project_id> in terminal will let you set the alias name you'd like to use. To deploy that specific alias, run firebase deploy --project <alias_or_project_id>.

dev  !!
