"1 Additional effort is needed in this area. Where appropriate, the governance
framework should reference existing policies and procedures that are linked to
personal data processing (for example, the information security policy or the identity
and access management policy). Likewise, organizational and technical concepts
and arrangements should be referenced to ensure consistency (for instance, any
existing data classification schemes or the determination of information asset
protection levels)." ,

"2 Improvements are needed to your enterprise's processing register. Governance
elements around a processing register include, but are not limited to:
Information assets used (from personal data register)
Purpose(s) of processing
Business processes or other organizational processes utilizing the assets
Processing life cycle from initial data acquisition to data deletion (planned or
ad hoc)
The governing process around the processing register should further define a role
or function responsible for maintaining the register, as well as accessibility of the
register to internal and external reviews. Further governance provisions might
include the scope and procedure for presenting the register as evidence, both
internally and externally. In situations where complex processing of large amounts
of personal data takes place, the register should be governed by a policy or
appropriate key operating procedure." ,

"3 Your enterprise needs to give further attention to this area. An enterprise should
establish, maintain, continuously monitor and adapt binding corporate rules that
adequately and comprehensively reflect the internal and external governance
framework. Activities in conjunction with BCRs include, but are not limited to:
Definition, description and approval of BCRs by senior management
Communication of BCRs on an enterprisewide basis
Annual or ad hoc validation and updating of BCRs

separate and/or dispersed data sets
Onboarding procedure for new data
Procedures and controls for third parties" ,

"10 Your enterprise needs to be better equipped to maintain data classification. At a
minimum, personal data classification should address:
General attribute of “personal” in accordance with GDPR; wider personal
relevance as PII if needed
Specific classification relating to special categories and purposes, including
limitations and additional security requirements
Classification in terms of nonrepudiation of transactions involving personal
data
Other aspects, such as applicable professional secrecy or restricted access
criteria" ,

"11 Your enterprise's personal data register needs improvement. At a minimum, the
personal data register process should address:
Type of data and aggregation (if any) into information assets
Relevant links between data sets that form information assets under GDPR
Data types and formats, including data not held in electronic formats (e.g.,
paper, microfiche)
Data location and instantiation, including multiple copies, virtualized and

Life cycle and life span information, including planned archiving and deletion
Linked processing steps, organizational units and processing purposes,
clearly detailing the when, why, where and by whom of personal data
processing",

"12 Your enterprise is only minimally equipped to manage special categories data. This
requires a robust process that identifies, controls and documents any processing of
data belonging to one or more special categories, covering at a minimum, but not
limited to:
Mapping of identified information assets to special categories in accordance
with GDPR
Documentation of justifying circumstances (as per GDPR) for each
information asset

competent authorities
Validation and internalization of erasure requests transferred by third parties
Defined interfaces to other processes, i.e., personal data register and
processing register, data classification and data life cycle
Approvals and independent-verification procedures around erasure
Erasure confirmation and communications procedure (to data subjects or
authorities)" ,

"14 If you haven't already, your enterprise should conduct a thorough risk evaluation.
The results of the risk evaluation should include, at a minimum:
Comprehensive register of events and threats leading to GDPR risk
categories
Frequency estimates and precautionary assumptions
Aggregation and clustering of events leading to the same risks materializing
Risk classification, usually in accordance with the overarching organizational
risk classification scheme",

"15 If you haven't already, your enterprise must conduct a thorough data protection
impact assessment. The DPIA must take into account existing controls and risk
mitigation measures, and aim at identifying the potential impact resulting from the
residual risk that has not been or cannot be fully mitigated." ,

"16 Your enterprise should make improvements to better manage risk treatment. The
risk treatment process should, at a minimum, cover the following:
Risk avoidance or elimination, including changes to processing
arrangements or discontinuation of processing (restructure or exit)
Risk elimination through additional controls or safeguards
Risk transfer, including restructuring of the personal data supply chain
Risk reduction through additional controls or mitigation measures

estimates and the event/threat universe
Review of effectiveness of treatment measures and activities, based on a
reasonable period of observation
Review of any incidents or breaches that may have occurred since the last
validation
Analysis of any changes to the framework and terms of reference, i.e., in
respect of any legislative or regulatory, political or financial events" ,

"18 Your enterprise could use some improvement in this area. Anonymization and
pseudonymization should cover, but are not limited to:
• Identification of personal data sets to be anonymized/pseudonymized
• Definition of techniques at all technical levels, e.g., file, database record,
nonelectronic filing systems
• Documentation and log of actual anonymization/pseudonymization
• Defined link to personal data register and processing register
• Recursive application of the need-to-know principle across the supply chain;
integration of the actual need to know with identity and access management" ,

"19 The encryption strategy and its components should be based on risk and efficiency,
making sure that GDPR risks are fully understood and internalized in any decision.
Your enterprise should make improvements in this area. At a minimum, the
encryption process should address:
• Definitive set of personal data and information assets to be encrypted,
based on the assigned protection levels and the GDPR risk and impact
• Definition of encryption techniques and targets, e.g., individual data,
database elements, whole databases, transactions, etc.
• Links to recognized or approved encryption techniques and tools already in
use within the enterprise
• Scope, plan and implementation steps for additional encryption needed for
personal data" ,

"20 Your enterprise should make enhancements to better manage protection levels. The
process around protection levels for personal data provides a defined interface
(both ways) between general information security and personal data security. DPP
practitioners and enterprises should reflect this by defining appropriate
organizational interfaces to support the information flow and the adequate
representation of personal data in protection level analyses." , 

"21 Your enterprise should make improvements to your resilience process. At a
minimum, the resilience process should cover:
• Personal data criticality, often expressed as a combination of integrity and
availability requirements
• Processing criticality as a function of time, i.e., maximum tolerable period of
unavailability, maximum tolerable data loss
• Recovery plans for personal data sets
• Defined links to general business continuity and IT service continuity plans
• Backup and restore concepts for personal data sets, linked to overall backup
and restore plans and procedures
• Multiple instantiation of personal data sets requiring high availability, i.e.,
fully resilient processing" ,

"22 Your enterprise needs to more effectively manage access to personal data. Access
restrictions and limitations resulting from personal data processing requirements
should be documented and fed into the general IAM process. The access
management process for personal data therefore provides an interface (both ways)
to general IAM. DPP practitioners and enterprises should reflect this by defining
appropriate organizational interfaces to support the information flow and the
adequate representation of personal data in access management." ,

"23 Your enterprise's process to manage testing and assessment of personal data
security could use another look. At a minimum, the process should address:
• Types of test and assessment, e.g., conceptual testing, vulnerability
scanning and penetration testing
• Frequency of testing
• Evidence of continual improvement, i.e., progressively more demanding
tests and assessments over time
• Test logging and securing evidence
• Analysis of weaknesses and documentation of improvement opportunities" ,

"24 Your enterprise's process for managing controllers and processors needs attention.
The process and processors should cover at least:
• Identification of primary and joint controllers, including individual or collective
purpose(s) for processing personal data

processing on behalf of one or more controllers
• Links to the personal data register, reflecting the data sets and the way they
are handled across the supply chain (data in flow; data at rest)
• Links to the processing register, reflecting the processes or process steps
performed by each actor in the supply chain
• Documentation of vendor (processor) management and control
arrangements, often embedded into general vendor management of an
enterprise" ,

"25 In complex supply chains, the subprocessing management process is an essential
element of ensuring GDPR conformance across the whole supply chain. Your
enterprise needs some improvement in this area. The subprocess management
process should cover, at a minimum:
• Formal request procedure to primary processors; disclosure of any further
outsourcing
• Documentation and register of subprocessing, including scope, extent and
purpose(s)
• Evidence of GDPR conformance, including processes, controls, concepts
and review results

"26 Your enterprise's processing agreements need some work. At a minimum, the
process around these agreements should cover:
• Definition, approval and roll-out of standardized agreements, including
templates
• Monitoring of fulfilment on a regular basis
• Planning and execution of reviews, primarily under the standard right to
audit
• Receipt, analysis and validation of third-party evidence for conformant
processing, e.g., certification and attestation reports
• Regular review and updating of processing agreements, terms and
conditions, in line with legislative and regulatory activity
• Termination and exit planning for individual contractual relationships" ,

"27 Your enterprise should make enhancements to manage supply chain impact. In a
supply chain with multiple actors, impacts resulting from GDPR risks may
materialize at any point and at any time. Therefore, DPP practitioners and
enterprises should apply their own DPIA approach to all parts of the supply chain
and document the feedback received from each of the parties. This includes
standardized reporting as well as ad hoc reviews or plausibility checks. The overall
impact should then be aggregated, based on the processing register and the flow of
data across various supply chain participants. Care should be taken in
understanding how impacts in one place may aggravate impacts in other parts of
the supply chain." ,

"28 Where personal data processing is performed in a supply chain, internal controls at
a processor or subprocessor must be as effective as the ones within the controller
organization. Your enterprise's current supply chain controls process is inadequate.
At a minimum, the process should cover the following:
• Obtaining and analyzing internal controls documentation from third parties
• Mapping to internal control system (ICS) at the controller organization
• Procedures for test of design (ToD), i.e., standard techniques for evaluating
controls
• Procedures for test of effectiveness (ToE), i.e., sampling and collecting
evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of controls at third parties
• Monitoring and log review arrangements, including accessibility of log data
inasmuch as these relate to personal data processing
• Point-in-time or continuous audit rights, including audit planning and
deployment" ,

"29 Your enterprise may not be prepared to manage notification in a timely manner. At a
minimum, the process of notifying supervisory authorities should include:

various channels of communication (individual, group, public)
• Predefined and approved key messages expressing the enterprise’s actions
(investigation, consequences, remediation, improvement, etc.)
• Organizational responsibilities with regard to formulating and conveying key
messages, e.g., involvement of the communications department, legal
advice, etc.
• Ad hoc communications facilities offered to data subjects, e.g., help line, free
phone number, dark site, etc." ,

"31 Your enterprise's incident and crisis management process has room for
improvement. From the perspective of DPP practitioners and organizational units
initially discovering the breach, the process should cover at least:
• Description and documentation of known facts and figures, in a standardized
format where appropriate
• Defined link to general escalation and alerting process, often defined by the
business crisis management (BCM) function
• Predefined generic personal data scenario for business continuity and crisis
management, similar to other special scenarios such as cyberattack,
pandemic, etc.
• Predefined relationships and communications channels with external actors,
i.e., external services such as investigative or forensics specialists
• Ongoing communications protocol between organizational line units and
incident/crisis management teams" ,

"32 Your enterprise should be better prepared to manage evidence and claims
appropriately. Personal data breaches represent instances of noncompliance but
also indicate that internal and/or external negligence or criminal activity may have
been present. The evidence and claims process should therefore cover, at a
minimum:
• Defined procedures for collecting and securing evidence, including chain of
custody
• Availability of specialized services such as IT forensics
• Procedure and templates for post incident analysis and reporting
• Procedure for substantiating claims against third parties, including the legal
or contractual basis for such claims
• Procedure for preparing defenses against claims by third parties, including
aspects of appeal (regulatory decisions)
• Defined link to post incident DPO reporting" ,

"33 Your enterprise's awareness process needs some work. At a minimum, the
enterprisewide awareness process should cover:

in awareness campaigns" ,

"34 Staff in your enterprise may not be adequately prepared to discharge their duties in
regards to data protection and privacy matters. Data protection and privacy
management, including the context of GDPR, require a set of skills and
qualifications that must be present in the enterprise or contracted through external
services. The management of skills and education is an essential process to ensure
that GDPR and its consequences are fully understood. The skills and education
process should include, but not be limited to:
• Definition of skills, levels and internal requirements for DPP-related tasks
and positions
• Mapping of skills to roles and organizational functions (matrix)
• Identification of suitable qualification levels and formal qualifications or
certifications, as needed for each part of the matrix

• Human resource and headcount planning
• Technical resource planning, including tools, licensing, etc.
• External service planning and budgeting, e.g., for consultants or legal
advisors
• Links to general financial reporting within the enterprise" ,

"38 Your DPO function is not well-represented in the overall enterprise. The
management process for organizational interfaces should cover at least:
• Documentation of regular, formal contacts throughout the enterprise
• DPO participation in standing committees and other formal institutional
meetings
• Regular communications between the DPO function and other
organizational units, including minutes and other reports
• Documented process steps requiring DPO involvement, including
consultation and information (RACI)" ,

"39 Formal internal and external reporting is an important part of the DPO function. Your
enterprise has issues that should be addressed in this area. At a minimum, the
reporting management process should cover:
• Reporting schedules for internal and external reporting to and by the DPO
function

permitted" ,

"41 Your enterprise's data acquisition controls need improvement. At a minimum, the
process for managing such controls should address:
• Identification of organizational processes that may intentionally or
incidentally acquire personal data
• Documentation of inbound data flows and data interfaces (i.e., written, web,
other)
• Identification of data origin where possible (i.e., direct from data subject,
controller, processor, other supply chain actors, etc.)
• Documentation of related controls in the internal controls register" ,

"42 Your enterprise's processing controls need improvement. The process of
maintaining such controls should cover:
• Identification of process steps, inputs and outputs that are to be controlled
• Identification of handover points to third parties, e.g., processors or
authorities
• Definition of control objectives and control types (e.g., preventive, detective,
corrective)
• Documentation of related controls in the internal controls register" ,

"43 Your enterprise's storage controls need improvement. The process of maintaining
such controls should cover at least:

"46 Your enterprise should make improvements to prepare to manage independent
reviews. Managing independent reviews further requires planning steps similar to
standard reviews, including notification, fieldwork, analysis and reporting. DPP
practitioners and enterprises may benefit from leveraging standardized audit and
review processes for DPP reviews. They should further link to the minimum
structure and content of DPO reporting as set down in GDPR." ,
