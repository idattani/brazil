"Your assessment of GDPR compliance is shown below based on your answers to the 46
statements. To help you prioritize, the results are shown in the order of the areas that need the
most attention. Please make sure to drill down into the statement details, as you may have a
category that shows the organization is in good condition, but one or more of the elements may
need particular attention. Note that the GDPR Assessment is designed as a high-level, quick
assessment; it should not be considered inclusive of all proper information, procedures and tests
or exclusive of other information, procedures and tests required in evaluating compliance with the
GDPR.",


"Maintain Data Governance - Some Areas to Improve
When processing personal data, Data protection and privacy (DPP) practitioners and
enterprises must provide comprehensive governance to ensure conformance with
GDPR requirements in a positive sense. The governing processes should enable all
associates and other internal and external stakeholders to rely on a defined set of
principles, policies and procedures that clearly define and explain how personal data
may be processed and how senior management and other leadership functions support
related activities." , 

"1. Establish Data Protection and Privacy (DPP) Governance Framework
Some additional effort would be useful in this area. Where appropriate, the
governance framework should reference existing policies and procedures that are
linked to personal data processing (for example, the information security policy or
the identity and access management policy). Likewise, organizational and technical
concepts and arrangements should be referenced to ensure consistency (for
instance, any existing data classification schemes or the determination of
information asset protection levels)." ,


"2. Maintain Processing Register 
Minor improvements may be needed to your enterprise's processing register.
Governance elements around a processing register include, but are not limited to:
• Information assets used (from personal data register)
• Purpose(s) of processing
• Business processes or other organizational processes utilizing the assets
• Processing life cycle from initial data acquisition to data deletion (planned or
ad hoc)
The governing process around the processing register should further define a role
or function responsible for maintaining the register, as well as accessibility of the
register to internal and external reviews. Further governance provisions might
include the scope and procedure for presenting the register as evidence, both
internally and externally. In situations where complex processing of large amounts
of personal data takes place, the register should be governed by a policy or
appropriate key operating procedure." ,

"3. Maintain Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) 
Your enterprise may need to make some improvements in this area. An enterprise
should establish, maintain, continuously monitor and adapt binding corporate rules
that adequately and comprehensively reflect the internal and external governance
framework. Activities in conjunction with BCRs include, but are not limited to:
• Definition, description and approval of BCRs by senior management
• Communication of BCRs on an enterprisewide basis
• Annual or ad hoc validation and updating of BCRs
• Integration of BCRs in third-party contractual relationships
• Monitoring of BCR conformance internally and externally" ,


"4. Maintain Rules for Consent 
Your enterprise's rules for consent may need minor enhancements. At a minimum,
governance provisions around consent should cover:
• Transparency and enabling information to data subjects
• Types of consent and related requirements
• Withdrawal of consent by data subjects
• Specific processes, controls and verification for child consent, including
appropriate verification of age and/or parental authority as well as parental
consent
• Communication channels, simplicity of language and accessibility of
consent-based interfaces" ,

"5. Maintain Rules for Data Subject Requests 
Your enterprise is moderately equipped to process data subject requests. At a
minimum, governance provisions around data subjects’ requests should cover:

within the enterprise
• Definition and implementation of remediation where applicable
• Identification of potential gaps or weaknesses leading to the complaint and
opportunities for improvement" , 

"7. Ensure Impartial Oversight 
Your enterprise should make minor adjustments to the governance process to
ensure impartial oversight. Activities in conjunction with impartial oversight include,
but are not limited to:
• Organizational roles performing and ensuring impartial oversight
• Roles and responsibilities (RACI), including demonstrated impartiality
• Objectives, scope and extent of oversight activities
• Risk-based frequency of oversight activities
• Procedures and guidance for planning, deploying and reporting
The acquisition of new personal data, identification of existing personal data and
classification of information assets form the basis for managing and controlling such
data in accordance with GDPR. DPP practitioners and enterprises must therefore
provide a robust process that ensures GDPR-conformant processing as well as efficient
data management. This process should also establish a defined and measurable life
cycle for personal data, taking into account the principle of data minimization.", 


"8. Manage Data Life Cycle 
Some additional effort would be useful in this area. At a minimum, the following
parts of the cycle should be defined and implemented:
• Data creation or acquisition, including the personal data processing (supply)
chain
• Information asset classification, including protection levels and assignment
to special categories
• Inclusion in the personal data register and the processing register and
removal from registers
• Actual processing and related controls
• Temporary and permanent storage, including virtualized and cloud storage
• Archiving and aggregation
• Deletion, both planned (end of life or end of purpose) and ad hoc (erasure
request, etc.)" ,

"9. Conduct Personal Data Identification 
Minor improvements may be needed to your enterprise's process to identify and
document personal data. The identification process should, at a minimum, address
the following aspects:
• Definition of criteria in accordance with GDPR
• Procedure for analyzing existing data sets, possibly in combination with the
analysis of security protection levels (CIA)
• Handover procedure to personal data register
• Analysis of potential inference (indirect identification of natural persons) from
separate and/or dispersed data sets
• Onboarding procedure for new data
• Procedures and controls for third parties" ,


"10. Maintain Data Classification
Your enterprise should make some enhancements in order to better maintain data
classification. At a minimum, personal data classification should address:
• General attribute of “personal” in accordance with GDPR; wider personal
relevance as PII if needed
• Specific classification relating to special categories and purposes, including
limitations and additional security requirements
• Classification in terms of nonrepudiation of transactions involving personal
data
• Other aspects, such as applicable professional secrecy or restricted access
criteria" ,

"11. Maintain Personal Data Register 
Your enterprise's personal data register is generally well-maintained. At a minimum,
the personal data register process should address:
• Type of data and aggregation (if any) into information assets
• Relevant links between data sets that form information assets under GDPR
• Data types and formats, including data not held in electronic formats (e.g.,
paper, microfiche)
• Data location and instantiation, including multiple copies, virtualized and
cloud images, etc.
• Life cycle and life span information, including planned archiving and deletion
• Linked processing steps, organizational units and processing purposes,
clearly detailing the when, why, where and by whom of personal data
processing" ,


"12. Manage Special Categories Data 
Your enterprise is moderately well-equipped to manage special categories data.
This requires a robust process that identifies, controls and documents any
processing of data belonging to one or more special categories, covering at a
minimum, but not limited to:
• Mapping of identified information assets to special categories in accordance
with GDPR
• Documentation of justifying circumstances (as per GDPR) for each
information asset
• Documentation of any new or changed classification of such information
assets
• Documentation of all communications with data subjects or supervisory
authorities as relating to the information asset
• Documentation of asset-related consent and withdrawal of consent
• Verified links to personal data register and processing register, including
evidence of processing that is restricted to the defined purpose(s)" ,

"13. Manage Erasure (Right to be Forgotten) 
Your enterprise is generally prepared to respond to demands for erasure. The
process should, at a minimum, address the following aspects:
• Receipt, confirmation and analysis of erasure requests by data subjects or
competent authorities
• Validation and internalization of erasure requests transferred by third parties
• Defined interfaces to other processes, i.e., personal data register and
processing register, data classification and data life cycle
• Approvals and independent-verification procedures around erasure
• Erasure confirmation and communications procedure (to data subjects or
authorities)" , 

"Manage Personal Data Risk Some Areas to Improve" , 


"14. Conduct Risk Evaluation 
Personal data processing is subject to a number of predefined risks that must be
identified, evaluated and treated in an adequate and appropriate manner. The potential
impact of these risks must be assessed and analyzed in view of existing risk mitigation
measures. The risk management process must further manage residual risk, using
recognized tools and standards.
Your enterprise may want to review your risk evaluation. The results of the risk
evaluation should include, at a minimum:
• Comprehensive register of events and threats leading to GDPR risk
categories
• Frequency estimates and precautionary assumptions
• Aggregation and clustering of events leading to the same risks materializing
• Risk classification, usually in accordance with the overarching organizational
risk classification scheme" ,

"15. Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
Your enterprise may want to review your DPIA for deficiencies. The DPIA must take
into account existing controls and risk mitigation measures, and aim at identifying
the potential impact resulting from the residual risk that has not been or cannot be
fully mitigated." ,



"16. Manage Risk Treatment 
Your enterprise is doing an adequate job managing risk treatment. As a reminder,
the risk treatment process should, at a minimum, cover the following:
• Risk avoidance or elimination, including changes to processing
arrangements or discontinuation of processing (restructure or exit)
• Risk elimination through additional controls or safeguards
• Risk transfer, including restructuring of the personal data supply chain
• Risk reduction through additional controls or mitigation measures
• Risk tolerance, based on the estimated frequency and impact" ,

"17. Conduct Risk Validation 
Your enterprise may want to consider minor enhancements to the risk validation
process. At a minimum, the risk validation process should address:
• Confirmation (or change) of risk evaluation results, including frequency
estimates and the event/threat universe
• Review of effectiveness of treatment measures and activities, based on a
reasonable period of observation
• Review of any incidents or breaches that may have occurred since the last
validation
• Analysis of any changes to the framework and terms of reference, i.e., in
respect of any legislative or regulatory, political or financial events" ,



"Manage Personal Data Security 
Personal data processing requires adequate and comprehensive security around the
information assets in scope. As personal data—and PII in the wider sense—represent a
significant business and financial value, they should be treated accordingly and
assigned an adequate level of protection in terms of confidentiality, integrity and
availability. The security process for personal data should ensure a reasonable level of
protection in view of the corresponding risks and impacts, making use of existing risk
evaluations and impact analyses. It should further leverage existing information security
processes to strengthen the protection of personal data." ,

"18. Manage Anonymization and Pseudonymization
Your enterprise is doing moderately good work in this area. Anonymization and
pseudonymization should cover, but are not limited to:
• Identification of personal data sets to be anonymized/pseudonymized
• Definition of techniques at all technical levels, e.g., file, database record,
nonelectronic filing systems
• Documentation and log of actual anonymization/pseudonymization
• Defined link to personal data register and processing register
• Recursive application of the need-to-know principle across the supply chain;
integration of the actual need to know with identity and access management" ,

"19. Manage Encryption 
The encryption strategy and its components should be based on risk and efficiency,
making sure that GDPR risks are fully understood and internalized in any decision.
Your enterprise is generally doing well in this area. As a reminder, at a minimum, the
encryption process should address:
• Definitive set of personal data and information assets to be encrypted,
based on the assigned protection levels and the GDPR risk and impact
• Definition of encryption techniques and targets, e.g., individual data,
database elements, whole databases, transactions, etc.
• Links to recognized or approved encryption techniques and tools already in
use within the enterprise
• Scope, plan and implementation steps for additional encryption needed for
personal data" ,


"20. Manage Protection Levels 
Your enterprise could make minor enhancements to better manage protection
levels. The process around protection levels for personal data provides a defined
interface (both ways) between general information security and personal data
security. DPP practitioners and enterprises should reflect this by defining
appropriate organizational interfaces to support the information flow and the
adequate representation of personal data in protection level analyses." ,

"21. Manage Resilience 
Your enterprise is moderately prepared to manage resilience. At a minimum, the
resilience process should cover:
• Personal data criticality, often expressed as a combination of integrity and
availability requirements
• Processing criticality as a function of time, i.e., maximum tolerable period of
unavailability, maximum tolerable data loss
• Recovery plans for personal data sets
• Defined links to general business continuity and IT service continuity plans
• Backup and restore concepts for personal data sets, linked to overall backup
and restore plans and procedures
• Multiple instantiation of personal data sets requiring high availability, i.e.,
fully resilient processing" ,

"22. Manage Access 
Your enterprise is somewhat effectively managing access to personal data. Access
restrictions and limitations resulting from personal data processing requirements
should be documented and fed into the general IAM process. The access
management process for personal data therefore provides an interface (both ways)
to general IAM. DPP practitioners and enterprises should reflect this by defining
appropriate organizational interfaces to support the information flow and the
adequate representation of personal data in access management." ,


"23. Manage Testing and Assessment 
Your enterprise generally has a good process in place to manage testing and
assessment of personal data security. As a reminder, at a minimum, the process
should address:
• Types of test and assessment, e.g., conceptual testing, vulnerability
scanning and penetration testing
• Frequency of testing
• Evidence of continual improvement, i.e., progressively more demanding
tests and assessments over time
• Test logging and securing evidence
• Analysis of weaknesses and documentation of improvement opportunities" ,

"Manage the Personal Data Supply Chain 
Where personal data is processed by more than one organization, the supply chain
across all controllers and processors must be managed and controlled in accordance
with GDPR. The management process therefore includes all controllers (jointly or
separately) as well as any subprocessors handling personal data. The supply chain
process is supported by processing agreements and supply chain controls, based on
the risks and potential impacts along the chain. It further replicates the governance
framework and its constituent parts from the primary level of controller(s) to any other
actors in the supply chain." , 


"24. Manage Controllers and Processors 
Your enterprise has a generally adequate process in place for managing controllers
and processors. As a reminder, the process should cover at least:
• Identification of primary and joint controllers, including individual or collective
purpose(s) for processing personal data
• Identification of processors, including the defined scope and extent of
processing on behalf of one or more controllers
• Links to the personal data register, reflecting the data sets and the way they
are handled across the supply chain (data in flow; data at rest)
• Links to the processing register, reflecting the processes or process steps
performed by each actor in the supply chain
• Documentation of vendor (processor) management and control
arrangements, often embedded into general vendor management of an
enterprise" ,

"25. Manage Subprocessing 
In complex supply chains, the subprocessing management process is an essential
element of ensuring GDPR conformance across the whole supply chain. Your
enterprise is doing generally well in this area. As a reminder, the subprocess
management process should cover, at a minimum:
• Formal request procedure to primary processors; disclosure of any further
outsourcing
• Documentation and register of subprocessing, including scope, extent and
purpose(s)
• Evidence of GDPR conformance, including processes, controls, concepts
and review results
• Audit reports and other independent assurance, if available
• Processing agreements between primary processors and subprocessors" ,


"26. Maintain Processing Agreements 
While your enterprise is doing generally well in this area, minor enhancements
could increase process effectiveness. At a minimum, the process around these
agreements should cover:
• Definition, approval and roll-out of standardized agreements, including
templates
• Monitoring of fulfilment on a regular basis
• Planning and execution of reviews, primarily under the standard right to
audit
• Receipt, analysis and validation of third-party evidence for conformant
processing, e.g., certification and attestation reports
• Regular review and updating of processing agreements, terms and
conditions, in line with legislative and regulatory activity
• Termination and exit planning for individual contractual relationships" ,

"27. Manage Supply Chain Impact 
Your enterprise is somewhat prepared in this area. In a supply chain with multiple
actors, impacts resulting from GDPR risks may materialize at any point and at any
time. Therefore, DPP practitioners and enterprises should apply their own DPIA
approach to all parts of the supply chain and document the feedback received from
each of the parties. This includes standardized reporting as well as ad hoc reviews
or plausibility checks. The overall impact should then be aggregated, based on the
processing register and the flow of data across various supply chain participants.
Care should be taken in understanding how impacts in one place may aggravate
impacts in other parts of the supply chain." ,


"28. Maintain Supply Chain Controls 
Where personal data processing is performed in a supply chain, internal controls at
a processor or subprocessor must be as effective as the ones within the controller
organization. Your enterprise's supply chain controls process is key to ensure that
this is the case. At a minimum, the process should cover the following:
• Obtaining and analyzing internal controls documentation from third parties
• Mapping to internal control system (ICS) at the controller organization
• Procedures for test of design (ToD), i.e., standard techniques for evaluating
controls
• Procedures for test of effectiveness (ToE), i.e., sampling and collecting
evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of controls at third parties
• Monitoring and log review arrangements, including accessibility of log data
inasmuch as these relate to personal data processing
• Point-in-time or continuous audit rights, including audit planning and
deployment" ,

"Manage Incidents and Breaches 
DPP-related incidents and breaches must be reported in line with GDPR. This includes
notification of supervisory authorities as well as communications with data subjects
actually or potentially affected by the breach. From an organizational perspective, the
incident (or eventual crisis) must be managed in terms of GDPR conformance as well
as business continuity and recovery of services and information. This requires a robust
incident and breach management process.", 


"29. Manage Notification 
Where personal data processing is performed in a supply chain, internal controls at
a processor or subprocessor must be as effective as the ones within the controller
organization. Your enterprise's supply chain controls process is key to ensure that
this is the case. At a minimum, the process should cover the following:
• Obtaining and analyzing internal controls documentation from third parties
• Mapping to internal control system (ICS) at the controller organization
• Procedures for test of design (ToD), i.e., standard techniques for evaluating
controls
• Procedures for test of effectiveness (ToE), i.e., sampling and collecting
evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of controls at third parties
• Monitoring and log review arrangements, including accessibility of log data
inasmuch as these relate to personal data processing
• Point-in-time or continuous audit rights, including audit planning and
deployment" , 

"30. Manage Data Subject Communications 
Your enterprise is generally equipped to notify data subjects in event of an incident
or breach. As a reminder, at a minimum, the process of notifying data subjects
should cover:
• Standardized reporting format and templates, adapted to and optimized for
various channels of communication (individual, group, public)
• Predefined and approved key messages expressing the enterprise’s actions
(investigation, consequences, remediation, improvement, etc.)
• Organizational responsibilities with regard to formulating and conveying key
messages, e.g., involvement of the communications department, legal
advice, etc.
• Ad hoc communications facilities offered to data subjects, e.g., help line, free
phone number, dark site, etc." , 


"31. Perform Incident and Crisis Management 
Your enterprise's incident and crisis management process is generally adequate.
From the perspective of DPP practitioners and organizational units initially
discovering the breach, the process should cover at least:
• Description and documentation of known facts and figures, in a standardized
format where appropriate
• Defined link to general escalation and alerting process, often defined by the
business crisis management (BCM) function
• Predefined generic personal data scenario for business continuity and crisis
management, similar to other special scenarios such as cyberattack,
pandemic, etc.
• Predefined relationships and communications channels with external actors,
i.e., external services such as investigative or forensics specialists
• Ongoing communications protocol between organizational line units and
incident/crisis management teams" ,

"32. Manage Evidence and Claims 
Your enterprise is adequately prepared to manage evidence and claims
appropriately. Personal data breaches represent instances of noncompliance but
also indicate that internal and/or external negligence or criminal activity may have
been present. The evidence and claims process should therefore cover, at a
minimum:
• Defined procedures for collecting and securing evidence, including chain of
custody
• Availability of specialized services such as IT forensics

aspects of appeal (regulatory decisions)
• Defined link to post incident DPO reporting" ,


"Create and Maintain Awareness 
Data protection and privacy (DPP) as fundamental values within an enterprise require
awareness and ongoing information and education about DPP. The awareness process
supports all other processes by explaining, communicating and reinforcing both GDPR
requirements and good practice. The awareness process further includes education,
training and qualification elements to ensure that enterprises have the requisite skill
sets and develop their expertise in line with legislative and regulatory developments." , 

"33. Maintain Enterprisewide Awareness 
Your enterprise is adequately maintaining enterprise awareness. At a minimum, the
enterprisewide awareness process should cover:

• Defined external training sources and providers for specific purposes, e.g.,
legal or DPO training" ,


"Organize DPO Function 
The GDPR mandates a data protection officer (DPO) as an individual or as a function.
A process is needed to ensure that once established, the DPO performs regular tasks
and interacts with other parts of the enterprise. In doing so, the DPO must further
ensure conformance with laws and regulations, and specifically with GDPR. This entails
the involvement of the DPO in any matters that might be related to personal data
processing, effectively creating a broad function that should be structured and well
organized." , 

"36. Maintain Data Protection Officer (DPO) Function
Your enterprise may need slight improvements in the DPO function. As a reminder,
at a minimum, the process of maintaining and running the DPO should cover the
following:

"Maintain Internal Controls 
Personal data processing in accordance with GDPR requires a comprehensive set of
internal controls that ensure compliance and provide reasonable assurance. The
process of maintaining internal controls over personal data processing should be fully
aligned with the general system of internal controls operated by the enterprise. As a
subset of controls, the PD processing controls should be supported by, and integrated
with, enterprise-level and general controls to avoid duplication or ambiguity. The
process of maintaining internal controls should further follow the personal data life
cycle, as indicated below." ,


"41. Maintain Data Acquisition Controls 
Your enterprise's data acquisition controls are somewhat well-maintained. As a
reminder, at a minimum, the process for managing such controls should address:
